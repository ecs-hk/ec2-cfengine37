# CFEngine 3.7 promises for Amazon Linux

## Synopsis

Baseline promises for managing AWS EC2 instances. Performs sshd, ntpd, and rsyslog configuration, keeps important services running, watches filesystem space, and checks for package security updates.

Supported OSes:
* Amazon Linux AMI release 2015.09
* RHEL 6
* RHEL 7

Tested with packages:
* `cfengine-community-3.7.1-1.x86_64.rpm`

Official CFEngine packages:
https://cfengine.com/product/community/

## Deploy to CFEngine hub

### One-time install and setup

On the hub system, install the CFEngine package and clone this git repository. Then:

```
# cp -r ./ec2-cfengine37/masterfiles/* /var/cfengine/masterfiles

# cp -r /var/cfengine/masterfiles/* /var/cfengine/inputs

# service cfengine3 restart
```

### Customize for your environment

Edit vars.acl in `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/def.json` to include subnets you wish to allow in.

Always, **always** validate your JSON after editing it, or else CFEngine will silently ignore it.

```
# python -m json.tool < def.json
```

You will also need to add a rule to your EC2 Security Group to allow in TCP 5308 from CFEngine agents to the CFEngine hub.

### Bootstrap to yourself

This bootstrapping step will put the hub under CFEngine management, just like all managed agents.

```
# cf-agent --bootstrap 172.31.21.122
```

Use the IP address of your CFEngine hub instead of the above.

## Deploy to CFEngine agent

### One-time install, then bootstrap to the hub

On each agent system, install the CFEngine package. Then:

```
# cf-agent --bootstrap 172.31.21.122
```

Use the IP address of your CFEngine hub instead of the above.

## Optional features

Optional features are _not_ enabled by default. Instead, they become active after the appropriate JSON configuration file is in place.

### Automatic installation of package security updates

By default, this promise collection warns (via logging) when package security updates are available. To install the package security updates automatically, create the file `/usr/local/etc/cfengine.json` on each CFEngine hub system where the auto-install is desired. Populate it with the following:

```
{
    "securityUpdates": "install"
}
```

### Promise logging to a MySQL DB (e.g. AWS RDS)

In order to send all logging generated by these promises (along with a few other important syslog messages) to a MySQL DB, create the file `/var/cfengine/masterfiles/services/autorun/z00_promise_data/json/rsyslog-mysql-creds.json` on your CFEngine hub. Populate it with appropriate URI and credential contents that follow the format:

```
{
    "host": "syslogdb.xyzxyz.us-southwest-88.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "pw": "goodpassword",
    "user": "someguy"
}
```
